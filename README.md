### Hi there 👋, my name is Jose Fernando
#### I'm an Electronic Engineer transitioning into the world of software development

Welcome to my GitHub space! I'm an Electronic Engineer by trade, but at heart, I'm a bit of a code whisperer. I've spent some quality time with circuits and solder, but these days, I'm all about slinging code and learning the ins and outs of software development!

## About Me
- 🎓 Bachelor's in Electronic Engineering at PUCP
- 💡 Found my true calling in coding and haven't looked back since.
- 📚 Currently self-learning and also studying the career of Software Development at ISIL
- 🛠️ Tech Interests: Full-Stack Development, Mobile Development
- 🌱 Learning: Java, C#
- 🔭 I’m currently working on the Odin Project Javascript Path 
- 🚀 I'm on a mission to blend my hardware know-how with my newfound love for software
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm afraid of heights!
